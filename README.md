🌍 Plastic Waste: A Growing Urban Challenge
Every day, cities generate tons of plastic waste — much of which goes unmanaged, polluting our streets, rivers, and environment. This growing problem highlights the urgent need for better waste management systems and data-driven solutions.

To explore this, I created a Plastic Waste Management Dashboard that shows how much waste is generated, collected, and left unaddressed across states. The goal is to turn raw numbers into awareness and encourage cleaner, more sustainable cities.

📊 From data to awareness — let’s rethink how we manage plastic waste.
